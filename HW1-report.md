## Git, GitHub

*What is the URL of the GitHub repo that you created in your personal account?*
  
https://github.com/kseeks61/Practice

Clone allows you to create a copy of the repository to your device. Pull adds any changes made to the repository from other users.

*You have committed a change on your local machine/remote. However, you want to undo the changes committed. How would you do that?*

git reset <file_name> for a specifc file or just git reset to undo all changes to all files.
## Markdown

*Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*

- Milk
- Eggs
- Diapers

*Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph must explain your favorite Olympic sport/game, the country that won the most number of olympic GOLD medals (Summer) in your favorite sport in 2020 (Japan) and 2024 (France). You are free to include more information.*

My favorite Olympic sport is *Basketball*. The **United States Men's Basketball** team have won gold in the past ***5 Summer Olympics***. `git add`

Below is a link for an article about their win in Paris and their current gold medal streak.

*Create a level 3 heading*

### My HW

*Insert a image of your favorite Olympics sport/game, sized appropriately*

## Tableau

*Insert the image of your horizontal bar chart here. Reminder, this should show countries that won the least number of medals only (excluding ZERO) in Paris2024 Summer Olynpics by continent (one country from each continent is ok).*

## Google Colab

*What is the URL of your Google Colab notebook?*

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bK91Fw5EU_5c-vI2kAXcJvtnEoURlatM

## Python/Seaborn

*Insert the first penguin chart here*

*Describe what the figure is showing.*

The graph above shows the penguin's bill length on the x-axis and their bill's depth on the y-axis in millimeters. Each point represents one penguin, showing their bill length and depth. It looks like their are two different types of penguins as seen by the cluster inn the top left of the graph and the cluster on the bottom right part of the graph. It seems that one group of penguins have a longer bill depth and shorter length, while the other has a shorter bill depth, but longer length.

*Insert the second penguin chart here*

*Describe what the figure is showing.*

The graph above is a bar chart of the weight comparing male and female penguins with three different species. It shows that all males weigh more than their female counterparts regardless of spceis. The graph also shows that the Gentoo species is the heaviest out of all penguin species in the chart.

*What happened when you removed the outer parentheses from the code? Why?*

It reports their is a syntax error with an unexpected indent. This is beacuse indents in Python are used to show that the code indented is part of the function above. For example, when using an if-else statement, you would put "if x=0:" on the first line and underneath you would indent the code and state what you want to do when the condition is met. Note that if you remove the indents and put the code all on one line it will work again.

## Observable and Vega-Lite

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`?*

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markPoint()`?*

*What change do you need to make to swap the x and y axes on the scatterplot?*

*Insert the bar chart image here*

*Why do you think this chart is the result of this code change?*

## References

*Every report must list the references (including the URL) that you consulted while completing the assignment. Replace the items below with the references you consulted*

* Reference 1, <https://www.example.com>
* Reference 2, <https://www.example.com/reallyreallyreally-extra-long-URI/>
