##### <ins>Initial Data Cleaning
To start the project, I first downloaded the data and uploaded it to OpenRefine. I then removed duplicate rows by sorting the data based on the movie name and "blanking down" all rows. This removes any duplicate row from the table. Next, I went through the genre column and replaced any data that did not make sense. For example, there were rows that said "add plot" or had the plot instead of the genre. I then repeated this process for the rest of the columns. Lastly, I nnoticed that the likes column had rows that were nnot considered a number because of the comma in them so I removed the commas and changed the values to numbers.

##### <ins>Refilling Empty Values
Continuing with the tasks outlined in the instructions, I changed all blank values in the rating, votes, and run times column by selecting the column as a numeric facet, including only blank cells, and then used the custom transformation to change the value to 0. I then repeated this process for the columns with text values, but instead of channging the value to 0, I changed it to N/A.


##### <ins>Fixing the Year Column
To start the cleaning process of the year column, I first removed the parentheses and "--" by using a replace function to delete the items. An example code is value.replace("(",""). Next I split the column into multiple columns by spaces by clicking the "Split column" button in the "Edit column" tab. This removes all the text after the year number/numbers. However, doing this will shift the year values with a roman numeral to the second row. To fix this, I created a numeric facet for the second year column, selected numeric values, then transformed the original year column to the values of the second year column, and lastly deleted the other year columns. Lastly, we still have one issue, in the first step I removed "â€“" because they were at the end of some years instead of only in between a range of years. To add this value back to the years that are in a range format, I converted the column back to the text format. This converted some of the values to a value such as 2000.0 so I used a replace function to remove the ".0" first. Finally, I used an if statement to select every value thats length was greater than 4 and added "--" in between the fourth number and fifth number in the value. The last step to clean the year column was to split the column by "--" into a start year and end year column. I did this by seletcing the "Split column" button under the year column and split it by "--". After this I created a numeric facet for the end year column, selected all blank rows and replaced it with the start year's value. Lastly, I noticed that there were still some blank values since they did not have a value in the start year columns as well and switched them to "N/A".

The following is the Python if statemnt mentioned above (assuming you switched the values to text and removed the .0):

    if len(value) > 4:
        return value[0,4] + "--" + value[4:]


##### <ins>Creating Verdict Column
The task of the cleaning process was to create a new column called Verdict, that returned "Not known" if the rating value was 0, "Flop" if the rating value was greater than zero but less than or equal to 4.5, "Average" if the value was greater than 4.5 but less than or equal to 6.5, "Hit" if the value was greater than 6.5 but less than or equal to 8.0, and "Super Hit" if the value was greater than 8.0. To complete this task I first selected the ratings columns and selcted the "Add column based on this column..." button in the "Edit column" tab. Once I clicked this, I named the new column "Verdict" and went into the transformation space where it stated "return value". I switched the code to Python since I am most famliar with it and wrote an if-elif-else statement for the conditions (elif stands for else if). Lastly, I created the column and checked the cells in a text facet to ensure the process went how I expected.

The following is the Python code to execute the conditional statement:


    if value == 0:
      return "Not known"
    elif 0 < value <= 4.5:
      return "Flop"
    elif 4.5 < value <= 6.5:
      return "Average"
    elif 6.5 < value <= 8.0:
      return "Hit"
    else:
      return "Super Hit"
